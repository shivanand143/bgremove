# Background Remover Web App

This is a Python-based web application for removing backgrounds from images. The application uses Flask as the backend framework and integrates the `rembg` library for background removal.

## Features

- Upload an image and remove its background instantly.
- Download the processed image in PNG format.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, `rembg` library
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (served from templates directory)
- **Dependencies**: Python, Pillow (`PIL`)

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivanand143/bgremove.git
   cd bgremove
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5. **Navigate to the web interface:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Deployment

The application can be deployed to any hosting platform that supports Flask, such as:

- **Heroku**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- **Netlify (frontend) + Appwrite or other backend hosting**

## API Endpoints

1. `/`: Renders the homepage.
2. `/remove-background`: Accepts a POST request with an image file for background removal.

## How It Works

1. Upload an image file in the web interface.
2. The server processes the file using the `rembg` library.
3. The processed image (with the background removed) is returned as a downloadable PNG.

## Known Issues

- Ensure the uploaded image is in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- Large image files may take longer to process.
